    <ul>
      <li>For my extra function, it's able to take one, two, or all three of the keys
          inside the object and return any album that has a matching key-value pair as
          the function argument. If I test two of the same keys, with different values,
          it only returns the final key-value pair match. How could I make it able to
          search for multiple of the same key?</li>
